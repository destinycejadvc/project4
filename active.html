<center><p>When engaging in physical activity, the blood vessels that go to your muscles dilate,
causing an increase in blood flow and oxygen to the working muscles. This, along with a
temporary increase in your metabolic rate, causes you to feel more energized. This “burst
of energy” not only occurs during exercise, but also after you exercise. For example,
working out in the morning or afternoon will cause you to feel energized throughout the
day. Even if you are an evening exerciser, you will still burn just as many calories and
feel better!</font></p></center>

<p><center>What health risks are linked to physical inactivity?
<dl>
<center>Lack of physical activity has clearly been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and other conditions:</center>

<dt>Less active and less fit people have a greater risk of developing high blood pressure.</dt>

<dt>Physical activity can reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes.</dt>

<dt>Studies show that physically active people are less likely to develop coronary heart disease than those who are inactive. This is even after researchers accounted for smoking, alcohol use, and diet.</dt>

<dt>Lack of physical activity can add to feelings of anxiety and depression. </dt>

<dt>Physical inactivity may increase the risk of certain cancers. </dt>

<dt>Physically active overweight or obese people significantly reduced their risk for disease with regular physical activity.</dt>

<dt>Older adults who are physically active can reduce their risk for falls and improve their ability to do daily activities</dt></center>
